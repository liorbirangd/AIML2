Fixed the errors
Have some issues with making the sensors visible


12-11-2024
Made the sensors visible
Total List of created scripts: HearingManager, HearingSensor, DetectableTarget, DetectableTargetManager, ProximitySensor,
UnitController, VisionSensor
All of them are in the Sensors file mentioned previously

In the SoccerFieldTwos prefab, gave all the strikers a UnitController, VisionSensor, DetectableTarget and 
HearingSensor script
In the SoccerFieldTwos prefab gave Soccer Ball, WallColliders, GoalBlue and GoalPurple a DetectableTarget script
In the SoccerTwos scene added a Manager object that contains a DetectableTargetManager and a HearingManager

In AgentSoccer script changed OnCollisionEnter and MoveAgent functions so that it calls OnSoundEmitted
Had to comment out the call to OnSoundEmitted in MoveAgent because it caused framerate drops, might be because my laptop
is just bad but we can decide to turn it on later
In SoccerBallController script changed OnCollisionEnter function so that it calls OnSoundEmitted

Finished the basic vision sensor
