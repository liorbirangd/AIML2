Explanation for the sensors

Sensors are made following this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku1sBjizDeI

Vision Sensor
All things that can be seen have a detectable target script and everything with that script is in a list of detectable targets
On each update, the vision sensor script goes trough every object in the list and sees if it is in the vision range

Proximity Sensor
Works the same as vision sensor but in a significantly shorter range and all around an agent

Hearing Sensor
Certain things create sound, which means they call the OnSoundEmitted function in the hearing manager script
This function then alerts all the hearing sensors and for every sensor that the source is in range of, that sensor
gets a message of the sound

Awareness
Different levels of awareness
All senses are funneled into awareness system
Vision has a curve so that awareness build up is slower around the peripherals than right in front
Each time an agent sees, hears or senses a target, awareness goes up
If the target can's be detected, Over time awerness will go down 
If awareness becomes zero, can no longer detect target
Awareness comes in different thresholds, when a treshholds changes a function is called

Summary
Followed to the tutorial to make 3 sensor, hearing vision and proximity
These sensors are funneled into a more general awareness system
Functions are called when the awareness threshold changes
